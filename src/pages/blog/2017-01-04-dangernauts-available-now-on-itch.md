## About the game

Dangernauts is a simple team game ...

Join Team Coral Reef or Team Algae Blooms as you venture under the sea. Maneuver your team's submarine and acquire the sea mine to destroy your enemy's base in a timed match. Enter the sub as one of four playable sailors; Sassy Scuba Guy, Wiggling Octopus, Merman of a different sort, and Mr. Shark.

## What you need to know before trying

This was a small project for us to get our feet wet and work out our development workflow. It is inspired by Regular Human Basketball and Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime. Try it out with your friends and keep an eye on our socials for our brand new original IP coming soon!
