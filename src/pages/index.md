        Windows. Join Team Coral Reef or Team Algae Blooms as you venture under
        the sea. Maneuver your team's submarine and acquire the sea mine to
        destroy your enemy's base in a timed match. Enter the sub as one of four
        playable sailors; Sassy Scuba Guy, Wiggling Octopus, Merman of a
        different sort, and Mr. Shark.
